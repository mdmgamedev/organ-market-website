                        <li>You buy an organ off of our website</li>
                        <li>We send you the organ via our trusted delivery service</li>
                        <li>You receive the organ and can use it as you wish</li>
                        <li>We are not responsible for any side effects or complications that may arise from using</li>
                        <li>If you don't like the product, you can always return it (read the return policy before returning)</li>
                    </ol>
